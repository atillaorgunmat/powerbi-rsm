    Create a root node capturing the overarching objective and break the work into child
    questions. Use the W‑W‑A‑E‑H format to ensure scope, value and risk are explicit.  Assign
    children to examine documents, derive tasks and map dependencies.  Confirm the root
    once children are scaffolded.
