## Generated Manifest
# This file records metadata about autoâ€‘generated artefacts such as mind maps,
# dependency graphs, status boards or Gantt charts produced via the `view` command.
# Each entry should include a unique ID, the question that triggered the
# generation (optional), the type of artefact, and the relative file path.
# Initially this list is empty; entries should be appended as artefacts
# are produced.
