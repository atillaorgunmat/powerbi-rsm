# Q‑013 – Access & Standardisation Plan

## Objective

Ensure that project files are consistently accessible across tools and environments.

## Canonical Workspace

- Use `/mnt/data` for **all** reads and writes.  Treat Google Drive as an upstream source for
  documents and assets, importing files into the canonical workspace as needed.

## Session Startup Probe

At the beginning of each session, run an environment probe that:

1. Lists files under `/mnt/data` and flags names with non‑ASCII characters or spaces.
2. Attempts to read the first 256 characters of each file to verify accessibility.
3. Summarises any issues in a diagnostics table stored in `details/Q-013_tests.md`.

## Import Flow

When files reside in Google Drive, identify the folder ID and use the connector to copy
documents into `/mnt/data/drive-import/<yyyymmdd>/`.  Rename files to use lowercase,
ASCII characters and hyphens; avoid spaces or smart hyphens.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens and dots.
- Avoid spaces, underscores or non‑ASCII punctuation.
- Apply version suffixes like `_v2.1` before the file extension.

## Rollback

If the probe detects missing files or permission issues, pause work and fix the environment
before proceeding.  Do not attempt to generate YAML or answer questions until access
issues are resolved.
