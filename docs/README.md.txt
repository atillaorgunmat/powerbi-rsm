# Q‑Chain v4 (tag‑first)

- **Questions** in `docs/Q_Chain/q/*.yaml` (sharded).
- Use `tags` with at least one `mod:*` tag to place a node under a module branch.
- `depends` may include `Q-*` (questions), `A-*` (assumptions), `E-*` (errors).
- Assumptions in `assumptions/manifest.yaml`; Errors in `errors/errors.yaml`.
- CI generates mindmaps to `docs/Project/mindmaps/` via PRs.
