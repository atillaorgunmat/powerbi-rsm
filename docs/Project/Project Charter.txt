Project Charter
Retail Multi‑Source KPI Suite – Sales, Operations & Executive Dashboards (Power BI Fabric)  Version 1.1  |  July 2025



## 1 | Vision & Purpose
Deliver a flagship, portfolio‑grade analytics solution that unifies Retail Sales, Store/Warehouse Operations and CRM engagement data into a single governed Power BI semantic model running on Microsoft Fabric (free tier).
The suite will


Break data silos
by combining an Order/Return CSV (OneDrive), a SQL Express Inventory‑Events log, and Customer/Interaction JSON (GitHub Pages).
Empower every persona
with role‑tailored dashboards (Sales, Operations, Executive) backed by drill‑through detail pages.
Showcase end‑to‑end BI craft
data modelling, ETL, DAX, UX, RLS, documentation & cloud deployment — evidence for freelance bids and interviews.
Strategic end‑state
“Any stakeholder can open their dashboard, trust the KPI they see, and drill in < 3 clicks to the transaction, inventory or customer touchpoint that explains it.”



## 2 | Objectives & Success Criteria
Objective
Measure of Success
Unified Semantic Model
One Power BI dataset refreshed on schedule; conformed Date, Product, Store, Customer dimensions shared across Sales, Inventory & CRM facts.
Role‑Specific Insight

• Sales – isolate under‑target region or promo in ≤ 3 clicks.
• Operations – spot root cause of a > 2 % shrinkage spike or stock‑out event.
• Executive – gauge revenue, margin, inventory health & customer retention in ≤ 30 s.
Semantic Consistency
KPIs (Revenue, Gross Margin %, Shrinkage %, Customer Conversion %, etc.) return identical values anywhere they surface.
Interactive Drill‑Through
From any headline KPI, users reach detail pages with correct filter context (e.g., click “Returns %” → itemised return reasons).
Portfolio Polish
Charter, ERD, KPI dictionary, User Guides & Loom tours published; peer reviewers score clarity ≥ 4 / 5.



## 3 | High‑Level Scope
In Scope
	•	Data Integration  
	◦	Sales: Order Header & Line Items CSV (OneDrive) incl. returns, payment type, promotion code.  
	◦	Operations: SQL Express InventoryEvents table (deliveries, re‑orders, shrinkage, damaged goods).  
	◦	CRM: Customer master & Interaction history JSON (GitHub Pages).  
	•	ETL / Architecture  
	◦	Fabric Dataflows (Staging → Transformation) → Star/Constellation dataset.  
	•	KPI Engineering  
	◦	Sales: Revenue, Gross Margin %, Average Order Value, Promo Uplift, Return %.  
	◦	Operations: Stock on Hand, Re‑order Frequency, Shrinkage %, Delivery Lead‑Time, Stock‑out Rate.  
	◦	Customer/CRM: Lead‑to‑Customer %, High‑Value Share, Interaction‑per‑Customer, Churn Rate.  
	◦	Cross‑domain: Sales per Sq Ft, Sell‑through Rate, Campaign ROI.  
	•	Dashboards & UX  
	◦	Sales – revenue vs target, promo performance, return drivers.  
	◦	Operations – inventory health, shrinkage drill‑down, supplier delivery SLA.  
	◦	Executive – revenue & margin trend, inventory risk flags, customer growth funnel.  
	◦	Bookmarks, drill‑through pages, smart narrative.  
	•	Governance Artefacts  
	◦	RLS demo (e.g., store manager sees only their store).  
	◦	Full documentation & risk log.  
Out of Scope
Real‑time streaming, ML demand‑forecasting, paid cloud capacity, mobile‑specific redesign, enterprise ALM pipeline (simulated only).

## 5 | Key Assumptions
	1	Sample data volumes (≤ 50 k order lines, ≤ 10 k inventory events, ≤ 5 k customers) fit free‑tier limits.  
	2	Microsoft 365, Fabric trial workspace and OneDrive storage remain available throughout the project.  
	3	A free SQL Express or Fabric Warehouse instance can host InventoryEvents without cost.  
	4	Stakeholder personas and scripted UAT scenarios substitute for live end‑users.  
	5	Daily scheduled refresh is sufficient; near‑real‑time not required.

## 7 | Governance & Approval
	•	Stage Gates: End‑of‑stage demo + 1‑page summary.  
	•	Change Control: Scope changes > ±10 % effort require sponsor approval.  
	•	Repo Structure: /docs (charter, ERD, KPI dictionary, risk log), /data, /pbix, /videos, /scripts.
