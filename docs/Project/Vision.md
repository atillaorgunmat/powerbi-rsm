Multi-Source KPI Suite – Sales, Operations & Executive Dashboards (Power BI)
Vision
The Multi-Source KPI Suite project aims to integrate data from sales, manufacturing operations, and customer relationship management into a unified analytics solution. By combining three distinct data sources into a single Power BI model, the project will break down data silos and provide a 360° view of business performance. This comprehensive dashboard suite is envisioned to enable data-driven decision-making at all levels – from daily operational adjustments on the factory floor to strategic planning in the boardroom. In addition, as a portfolio flagship project, it will demonstrate end-to-end BI solution skills (data modeling, ETL, DAX, etc.) in a realistic scenario, enhancing credibility for freelance Upwork engagements and corporate job interviews. We assume a realistic scenario of a mid-size enterprise seeking better insights.
