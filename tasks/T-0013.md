# T-0013 · Design Promotion & Campaign M2M Strategy

**Phase:** P-02
**State:** Done  
**Depends on:**  
- T-0012 (Snapshot & SCD explicitly confirmed)
- T-0008 (Data-Spec Sheet explicitly confirmed)

---

## Focus
Explicitly model the realistic many-to-many relationship between Promotions and Orders (multiple promotions per order/item), and define a Campaign hierarchy dimension for deeper marketing analytics.

---

## Deliverables
1. **Promotion M2M Fact Table** (`FactOrderItemPromotion`) explicitly documented, including grain, keys, and attributes.
2. **Campaign Dimension** (`DimCampaign`) explicitly defined, linked hierarchically to existing Promotions.
3. **Updated Data-Spec Sheet v3.0** explicitly including new tables and relationships clearly documented.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Promotion-to-Order relationship explicitly supports multiple promotions per order line.
- Campaign dimension hierarchy explicitly documented (Campaign → Promotion).
- Explicit Governor confirmation of all structural changes and new dimension.

---

## Work Steps (MECE)
1. **Draft FactOrderItemPromotion**: Explicitly define fact table with keys and grain to handle M2M.
2. **Draft DimCampaign**: Explicitly define dimension table including campaign attributes, hierarchy, and linking keys.
3. **Update ERD explicitly**: Include new M2M structure and dimension.
4. **Governor explicit review & approval**.
5. **Explicit Data-Spec Sheet v3.0 Update**: Integrate and confirm explicitly with new structures.

---

## Rationale
Current explicit single-promotion-per-order model insufficient for realistic campaign analytics. Explicit M2M design allows accurate measurement of complex promotions and marketing initiatives, improving accuracy for Promo Uplift and Campaign ROI KPIs.

---

## Definition of Done
"Explicitly documented Promotion M2M and Campaign dimension strategy confirmed; Data-Spec Sheet explicitly updated (v3.0); Governor explicit approval."

**Log**
- *YYYY-MM-DD Executor →* Task explicitly created and ready for execution.
