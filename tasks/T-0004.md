# T-0004 · Seed FactLog + Context-Kit SOP

**Phase:** P-01  
**State:** Done  
**Depends on:** T-0002  
**Definition of Done:**  
- FactLog.md exists, initial immutable facts recorded explicitly.  
- Context-Kit SOP clearly documented at bottom of FactLog.md.
- FactLog.md and T-0004.md committed explicitly.

**Rationale:**  
Locks external constraints, prevents hidden assumptions, and standardizes session bootstrap for consistent Executor context.

**Log:**  
- 2025-06-25 Governor → Confirmed initial content explicitly.
- 2025-06-25 Executor → Task Markdown explicitly created, moved to In-Progress.
