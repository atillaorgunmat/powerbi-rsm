# T-0009 · Build **Data_KPI_Trace Matrix**

**Phase:** P-03 · Data Quality & Traceability  
**State:** Planned  
**Depends on:**  

- T-0007 (KPI List validated)  
- T-0008 (Data-Spec Sheet confirmed):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Focus  

Create a single, authoritative **Data_KPI_Trace Matrix** that shows—row-by-row—how every approved KPI is computed from specific tables, fields, and transformations in the confirmed star schema.

## Deliverables  

1. **Data_KPI_Trace.md** (or `.xlsx`) saved to `/docs/` containing at minimum these columns:  
   | Domain | KPI | Grain | Source Table | Source Fields | Transform / Aggregation | SCD Impact? | Coverage Status | Notes |  
2. Gap list (if any fields/links are missing) appended at bottom of the matrix.  
3. Control-thread summary (≤ 5 bullets) for Governor confirmation.

## Acceptance  

- All 16 KPIs in KPI List v1.0 appear exactly once.  
- Every KPI row cites only fields present in **Data-Spec Sheet**; no “TBD.”  
- Coverage Status column shows *Covered* for each KPI (or explicit ticket # if gap raised).  
- Governor replies **CONFIRM T-0009** in Control Thread.

## Work Steps (MECE)  

1. **Extract KPI inventory** from `KPI List v1.0.md` and `KPI_Cards.md`.  
2. **Extract field catalog** from `Data-Spec Sheet.md` dimension & fact sections.  
3. **Populate matrix**: map each KPI → table(s)/field(s) → transform logic.  
4. **Mark SCD impact** if KPI relies on Type-2 dimensions (e.g., UnitCost in DimProduct).  
5. **Flag gaps**: missing fields or unclear grain; propose remediation tasks if found.  
6. Save file, commit to `/docs/`, log completion in Storyboard, and post summary.

## Rationale  

Provides end-to-end lineage proving that every business metric can be traced back to a concrete, governed data element—fulfilling traceability best practice noted in Data-Spec validation plan.

## Definition of Done  

“Matrix complete, reviewed, no gaps; Governor confirmed.”
