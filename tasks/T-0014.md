# T-0014 · Design Lead Funnel Lifecycle Fact

**Phase:** P-02 · Initiation & Detailed Planning  
**State:** Done  
**Depends on:**  
- T-0008 (Data-Spec Sheet explicitly confirmed)
- T-0012 (Snapshot & SCD Strategy explicitly confirmed)

---

## Focus
Explicitly design and document a new **Lead Funnel Lifecycle Fact** to accurately track customer lead progression from initial contact through various funnel stages to customer conversion.

---

## Deliverables

1. **Lead Funnel Fact Document** (`Lead_Funnel_Lifecycle.md`) explicitly covering:
   - Explicit table structure (`FactLeadLifecycle`) including columns, grain, and stage tracking (Lead → Qualified → Opportunity → Customer).
   - Explicit definition of funnel stage timestamps and statuses.
   - Explicit linkage to existing dimension tables (DimCustomer, DimSalesRep).

2. Explicitly updated **Data-Spec Sheet v2.2**, clearly incorporating new lead funnel lifecycle fact table and required attributes.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Explicit Governor approval of Lead Funnel Lifecycle Fact document explicitly detailing structure and funnel logic.
- **Data-Spec Sheet v2.2** explicitly updated and approved by Governor.

---

## Work Steps (MECE)
1. **Review existing customer acquisition fields** (LeadSource, JoinDate).
2. **Explicitly define funnel stages** (e.g., Initial Lead, Qualified, Opportunity, Converted Customer), explicitly including timestamps and flags.
3. **Design FactLeadLifecycle table explicitly**, clearly defining grain and relationships.
4. **Explicitly document linkage to DimCustomer** (and DimSalesRep if applicable).
5. **Governor explicit review and confirmation** of all clearly documented changes.
6. **Explicitly update Data-Spec Sheet v2.2** to include new lead funnel fact table structure.

---

## Rationale
Addresses the explicit gap identified for the "Lead-to-Customer %" KPI, ensuring clearly auditable, timestamped, and accurate reporting on customer acquisition funnel metrics:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

## Definition of Done
"Explicitly documented Lead Funnel Lifecycle Fact structure confirmed, Data-Spec Sheet explicitly updated (v2.2), Governor explicitly approves."
