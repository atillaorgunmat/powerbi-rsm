# T-0001 · Create / Verify Folder Skeleton
**Phase:** P-01  
**State:** Done  
**Depends on:** —  
**Definition of Done:** Folder tree, placeholder markdowns, local git init, proof of structure.  
**Rationale:** Foundation for all subsequent artefacts.  

**Log:**  
- 2025-06-25 Governor → Executed folder creation, git init, ls -R verified.
- Initial Evaluation:
Assessed clearly defined criteria (scope, dependencies, effort) to confirm readiness.

- Pre-Start Considerations:
Reviewed carefully each setup consideration:

- Project-root location defined (~/Projects/PowerBI-RSM).

- Version control decided as local Git (without immediate GitHub integration).

- Toolchain chosen clearly (VS Code) and recommended extensions installed.

- Backup strategy confirmed local-only (no cloud backups).

- Placeholder content defined and created (minimal markdown headers).

- Automation hooks prepared (/scripts folder).

- Actual Execution (Governor terminal actions):
Created directories and placeholder files correctly (tasks, phases, scratch, scripts, and markdown files).

- Initialized Git repository, created initial commit, and confirmed the commit.

- Accuracy Check & Adjustments:
Verified structure explicitly (terminal ls -R output confirmed).
Identified /scripts was initially untracked and rectified by adding .gitkeep.
Created and saved VS Code workspace explicitly (PowerBI-RSM.code-workspace).

- Current Confirmed Status:
Folder skeleton fully established, tracked, and version-controlled.
VS Code workspace configured and ready for active use.
